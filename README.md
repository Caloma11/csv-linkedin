#### We aim to make it easy for analysts and managers to clean CSV files that often get "messy" when extracting from databases.

Users should be able to do the following:

- As a user I can login from the Navbar
- As a logged out user I can see an "About" page, which details what I can/can't do if I don't have a profile
- As a user I can login with my LinkedIn, Google or Github
- As a user I can upload a file from dropbox, Google Drive or local computer
- As a logged in user I can have a dashboard with
  - Number of uploads
  - Date of uploads (with their ratings)
  - Type of uploads
  - Visuals
  - Most common algorithms selected (amongst all users)
- As a logged in user, I can review how the algorithm performed with number of stars and comments
- As a user I expect my file to be removed from the server
- As a logged in user I can receieve an email notification when it is done
